## NOTES  

1.  Reactive design - as I worked, I tackled problems, and adapted my design to work with the new problems that arose each time I fixed one. It's not exactly what you are looking for, but I feel I covered most of the requirements of the assignment.  
2.  The focus of this assignment was on the Javascript, so there is no external CSS.  I did use inline style attributes to make the information more readable, but avoided any actual styling.  

## ATTRIBUTIONS  

- Patrick Teskey for assistance with appendChild() method
- Vitaly Gins and Aidan O'Reilly for assistance fixing gallery output scope issue
