## NOTES  

1.  Reactive design - as I worked, I tackled problems, and adapted my design to work with the new problems that arose each time I fixed one. It's not exactly what you are looking for, but I feel I covered most of the requirements of the assignment.  
2.  The focus of this assignment was on the Javascript, so there is no external CSS.  I did use inline style attributes to make the information more readable, but avoided any actual styling. 
3.  There is a design flaw with the links.  They appear before the random picture button is clicked, but do not work until the button is clicked.  This is because the href attribute is being set from the object item for each link.  I would have fixed this, but at this point I realized you wanted a gallery so shifted directions and put in the "display all pictures" button.  Like I mentioned, design driven and started without a clear picture of the final goal.
